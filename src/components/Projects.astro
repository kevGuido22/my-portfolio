                Some of the projects I have worked. I used different
                technologies and skills in frontend and backend development, as
                well as in UX/UI design and devOps. This allowed me to solve
                technical challenges and create solutions in different areas of
                software development.

            description={"This is a practice project built to learn and explore microservices architecture using Spring Boot. Each microservice is containerized with Docker, and database migrations are managed with Flyway to ensure version control. An API Gateway was implemented to handle all requests through a single entry point, improving scalability and routing. To ensure resilience, Resilience4j was added to manage failures when services do not respond. Keycloak was integrated for authentication and authorization, providing centralized and secure identity management across all services."}
