                Hi! I'm Kevin Guido, a software developer from Costa Rica. Iâ€™m a
                person who is committed to quality and continuous improvement. I
                enjoy both frontend and backend development and I take on the
                challenges they bring, always looking for useful solutions that
                make a difference.

                I consider myself self-taught and, as a professional, I always
                give my best. I enjoy learning new things and constantly growing
                in the world of software development.
